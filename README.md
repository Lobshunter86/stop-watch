# stop-watch

A self performance analysis tool inspired by http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2021-05-29/moving-to-australia.html
> I use a stopwatch to help me stay productive: I pause it whenever I have an interruption, and measure how many hours of uninterrupted work I get done each day, log it, and then plot it on graphs to see the trends.

This tool will start the watch when you tap start, and the counter will be exported as prometheus counter vector.
So that it's easy to monitor the trends on grafana.


## TODO
- support multiple stop-watches
- add same example pictures
- make code less sh*tty
